    "introduction": "A team of collaborators from across the United States have been awarded a 5-year $2.5 million National Science Foundation research grant. This grant is funded through the Macrosystems program and Ecosystems Directorate. The grant is titled “On thin ice- implications of shorter winters for the future of freshwater phytoplankton phenology and function,” and is nicknamed the “Thin Ice Project.” We aim to explore how warming temperatures and shorter winters from climate change can affect the growth and toxicity of lake algae. The collaborators for the Thin Ice Project are Dr. Rebecca North (University of Missouri), Dr. Mindy Morales (University of Vermont), Dr. Meredith Holgerson (Cornell University), Dr. Bella Oleksy (University of Colorado Boulder), and Dr. David Richardson (SUNY New Paltz). We will sample lake phytoplankton (algae) across the country to see what will happen to the future of lakes, especially in understudied winter."
