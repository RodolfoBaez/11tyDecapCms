Last weekend, I visited Mohonk Lake and had an incredible experience. The fall colors were absolutely stunning.

## Getting There

The hike to the lake took about 2 hours. The trail was well-marked and moderately challenging.

## What I Saw

The lake was crystal clear, and the surrounding mountains created a perfect reflection on the water. I spotted several birds and even a deer!

## Conclusion

If you're in the area, I highly recommend visiting Mohonk Lake, especially during autumn.
