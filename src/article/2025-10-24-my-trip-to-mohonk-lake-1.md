As researchers, we used environmental sensors to monitor changes in lake water quality data. This was the focus of our research because lakes are a vital economic, recreational and environmental resource in the Hudson Valley where we are based. The EXO1 was the specific e[nvironmental sensor we ](google.com)

used in our selected lakes Mohonk and Osiris. The EXO1 can sense parameters such as temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, and chlorophyll simultaneously, making it a very efficient research tool. Before it could be used in the field, it required calibration for each parameter in a specific water solution, so that it would read accurate measurements. After exporting the data from the EXO1, we used the R programming language to process and visualize the data collected. One of our visualizations revealed an anomaly in Mohonk Lake: oxygen and chlorophyll levels are expected to be highest at lakes surface but at Mohonk they were highest about 9 meters down. We also used R to create graphs of historical data available to us, which showed irrefutable evidence that temperature in the Mohonk area has increased over the past 130 years.
